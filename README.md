**Student Lifestyle Data Analysis**

This project analyzes the relationship between student lifestyle habits and their academic performance (GPA). Using Python, we apply Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to understand and predict GPA based on various lifestyle factors.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes:

1. Features: Study hours, sleep hours, extracurricular activities, social hours, and physical activity.

2. Target: GPA (Grade Point Average).

Features of the Analysis
1. Linear Regression:

   Predicts GPA based on lifestyle factors.
   Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
   Includes a plot showing predicted vs. actual GPA.

2. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):

   Predicts GPA using a non-linear approach.
   Tests different k values to find the optimal one.
   Evaluates performance using MSE.
3. Visualization:

   Scatter plot of study hours vs. GPA.
   A graph showing MSE for different k values in k-NN.

**Key Insights**
Study hours positively correlate with GPA, but other factors like sleep and extracurricular activities also play a role.
Linear Regression provides a simple prediction model, while k-NN performs better for non-linear patterns.
